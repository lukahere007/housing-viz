# ðŸ§ª Vaccine-Induced Immune Response Simulation

This project simulates and analyzes antibody responses after vaccination using a synthetic clinical dataset.

- Simulates patient demographic and health data
- Models antibody titers over 4 timepoints (0, 14, 28, 90 days)
- Performs ANOVA and logistic regression
- Visualizes dose effects and highlights top responders
